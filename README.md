BC Gov OpenShift Container Platform deployment automation

## Getting Started

We are going to be using a set of tools to manage OpenShift cluster deployments.

These tools are:

* bash
* terraform
* vscode
* asdf version manager
* platform specific CLIs and plugins

### Prerequisites

For each specific platform, run the installer to get started.

For example, to use IBM, run

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd platforms/ibm;
.\prerequisites.sh;
```
